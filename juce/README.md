# HachiShifter Next — JUCE native rewrite

`next` is the native JUCE/C++20 rewrite of HachiShifter. The former Tauri/Vue
frontend and Rust backend have been removed from this branch; their history
remains available on `main` for regression reference.

## Current native foundation

- JUCE 8, C++20 and CMake;
- model-free Windows and Linux packages;
- native multi-track project model with BPM and beat-origin persistence;
- sample-accurate multi-track transport, clip gain/pan and overlap fades, with
  draggable clip-fade handles and direct clip mute/gain controls;
- sample-rate-independent reader/resampling path;
- legacy-compatible dark piano roll using `#7F69CA`, `#CBCBFA` and `#F4C000`,
  plus the source-edit wrench mode;
- pitch contours remain relative to the note centre when a note is dragged;
- freehand and line target-pitch editing while retaining the source F0 contour;
- whole-clip stretching from either timeline handle, with note, source/target
  pitch, consonant, sibilant and fade timing kept in sync;
- Melodyne-compatible pitch-modulation and pitch-drift correction controls,
  including exact restoration of zero-modulation flattened notes;
- switchable per-track pitch/stretch render routes after Melodyne import;
- independently configurable default pitch and stretch routes for Melodyne imports;
- optional neutral Melodyne import that retains arrangement/source F0 while
  clearing saved tuning, Attack, level and timbre corrections;
- one GAME+FCPE analysis service shared by Settings, audio import, Melodyne
  source-F0 reanalysis, CLI and MCP, with explicit large/small model discovery
  and a 16 kHz/5 ms native C++ fallback while project targets stay intact;
- native ONNX Runtime GAME encoder/segmenter/boundary-to-duration/estimator
  inference with metadata-driven inputs, plus FCPE 128-bin Slaney-mel F0 and
  explicit 5 ms STFT-centre timing compensation;
- shared ONNX execution settings for GAME, FCPE and NSF-HiFiGAN, with selectable
  GPU 0-7 and DirectML runtime packaging on Windows;
- editable Melodyne Attack boundary and Attack Speed with independent time mapping;
- voiced gaps, consonant shading, sibilant markers and note joins;
- native project save/load (`.hjpx`, with legacy `.hspx` open compatibility);
- portable HJPX media paths with relative and recursive project-folder relinking;
- MCP project editing, pre-render, WAV export and transport control, including
  selected-backend and render-progress inspection;
- MCP HJM region editing, UTAU oto import/export and recursive voicebank registration;
- complete strings for zh-CN, zh-TW, ja-JP, ko-KR and en-US.
- translated settings choices that update immediately with the selected UI language.

## Native backend

Production code lives under `juce/`. `src/backend` contains model-free DSP and
parallel offline render services; realtime transport and project scheduling are
implemented by `AudioEngine`. Additional analysis backends are added as C++
services rather than restoring the removed web/Rust layers.

## Cloud build

No local build is required. GitHub is mirrored to the self-hosted GitLab and
pushes to `next` create model-free Linux and Windows archives with GitLab CI.
For Windows-only fixes, set `WINDOWS_ONLY=1` or include `[windows-only]` in the
commit message so the Linux job is skipped.
